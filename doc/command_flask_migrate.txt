$ flask db init

This will add a migrations folder to your application. 
The contents of this folder need to be added to version control along with your other source files.

$ flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."

The migration script needs to be reviewed and edited, as Alembic is not always able to detect every change you make to your models. 
In particular, Alembic is currently unable to detect table name changes, 
column name changes, or anonymously named constraints. A detailed summary of limitations can be found in the Alembic autogenerate documentation. 
Once finalized, the migration script also needs to be added to version control.

$ flask db upgrade

Apply the changes described by the migration script to your database


Note:
Each time the database models change, repeat the migrate and upgrade commands
That the application script must be set in the FLASK_APP environment variable for all the above commands to work, as required by the flask command.
if application file name is wsgi or app, it does not needs the FLASK_APP environment variable.
